# Health-Insuarance-Database-Management
Health Insurance Database Management using MySQL and MongoDB

In the project “Insurance database management system” we have developed a relational database to manage the insertion, storage and efficient retrieval of the data of the insurance company. We first gathered the domain knowledge of working of the insurance company and the challenges faced by them. Then we tried to implement part of the problem by listing the required information and assumed a health insurance product as a business case for our project. We made an Enhanced Entity Relation Diagram of the insurance product and made a Class diagram using the gathered information. We then used both of the diagrams to construct a relational model before implementing it in MySQL. Since there was no readily available dataset in the public domain we created our own dataset which resembled the real-world scenario. The project used DML and DDL commands present in RDBMS. Using the MySQL Workbench we created several tables and imported the dataset into MySQL. We developed various real-world situations relevant to our business case and retrieved the answers to them using SQL queries. Along with that we managed our part of the database in the NoSQL (MongoDB) environment and used MapReduce and aggregate functions. Also, we accessed our database using R and made an analysis of the retrieved data.
